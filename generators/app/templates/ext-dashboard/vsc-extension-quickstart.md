# Welcome to your Azure Data Studio Extension

## What's in the folder
* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your dashboard insight extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the list of insights and new dashboard tabs for the extension. Open this in Azure Data Studio and edit the `contributes` section to add new features.
  * `dashboard.insights` section is where your insight definition is added. This is a bar chart insight by default. You can add additional insights here.
  * `dashboard.containers` section is where you can register containers for your dashboard. It accepts an object or an array of the object.
  * `dashboard.tabs` section is where you register a new "tab" or area in the dashboard for your extension, and include your new insight. If you select `No` for the `Add a full dashboard tab?` question this will not be added, and instead you can use the insight in other tabs / in the home tab.
  * `commands` section is where you register your commands. You can add or modify your command in this section. The functionalites of commands are defined in `src/controllers/mainControllers.js`.
  * `dashboard/toolbar` section is where you register a new homepage action according to the command you defined. If you select `No` for the `Add a homepage action?` question this will not be added, and instead you can register these actions in the dashboard toolbar.
  * `tasks-widget` section is where you register a new dashboard toolbar. If you select `No` for the `Add a dashboard toolbar?` question this will not be added, and instead you can register a navigation section.
  * `nav-section` section is where you create a navigation section. The default template comes with a webview.


* `src/controllers/mainController.js` - this is the file that you register commands and define functionalities of them.
* `src/controllers/webviewExample.html` - this is the html file that opened by default from the `Get Webview` command on the toolbar and also the default webview shown on the navigation section.
* `src/notebook/sample.ipynb` - this is the notebook file that opened by default from the `Get Notebook` command on the toolbar.
