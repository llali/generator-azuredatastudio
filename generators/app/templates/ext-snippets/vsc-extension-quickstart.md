# Welcome to your SQL Operations Studio Extension

## What's in the folder
* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the snippet file
and specifies the language of the snippets.
* `snippets/snippets.json` - the file containing all snippets.

## Get up and running straight away
* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Create a new file with a file name suffix matching your language.
* Verify that your snippets are proposed on intellisense.

## Make changes
* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the SQL Operations Studio window with your extension to load your changes.

## Install your extension
* To start using your extension with SQL Operations Studio copy it into the `<user home>/.sqlops/extensions` folder and restart SqlOps.
* To share your extension with the world, read on https://github.com/microsoft/sqlopsstudio/wiki/Getting-started-with-Extensibility about publishing an extension.
