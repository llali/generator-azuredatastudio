# Welcome to your Azure Data  Studio Extension Pack

## What's in the folder
* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension pack.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the list of extensions of the extension pack.

## Get up and running straight away
* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Open `Extensions Viewlet` and check your extensions are installed.

## Make changes
* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the Azure Data  Studio window with your extension to load your changes.

## Install your extension
* To start using your extension with Azure Data  Studio copy it into the `<user home>/.azuredatastudio/extensions` folder and restart Azure Data Studio.
* To share your extension with the world, read on https://github.com/microsoft/sqlopsstudio/wiki/Getting-started-with-Extensibility about publishing an extension.
